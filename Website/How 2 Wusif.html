To teach wusif a response, use the !learn or !teach command with the trigger and response seperated by an |. Spaces don't matter, but the length is limited to the standard IRC message line (around 500 characters). Multiple responses in the same line is also supported and will be picked at random based on the amount of responses saved for a trigger. Triggers are searched by closest matches so single words or short triggers work better, but words can be searched within longer triggers:
</p>
<li>!teach This is a trigger | And this is a response!</li>
<li>!learn Hey There!|Hey to you too! ;) !teach Trigger | Response 1 | Response 2 | Oh iy</li>

To see how many responses match a phrase, use the !find command followed by the phrase:
<li>!find Joe</li>
<li>!find Trixar_za is God</li>

To make wusif forget a learned response use the !forget command followed by the phrase:
<li>!forget Joe</li>
<li>!forget Trixar_za is dumb</li>

To see how many responses wusif has learned so far you can use the !responses command:
<li>!responses</li>

You can also teach wusif to respond with an action instead of a message by prefixing plus (+) to the response:
<li>!teach I Love you!|+hugs #nick</li>
