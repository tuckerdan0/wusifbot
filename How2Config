To set up IRC bot functions, "pyborg-irc.cfg" is what you are looking for.

---------------------

Edit pyborg.cfg, and pyborg-irc.cfg (created the first time you run pyborg-irc)
to configure the bot.

      thanks to the order !limit

    * censored: the list of the censured words. Can be changed with the order

The aliases and censored words are regular expression. This mean that you can
set an aliases like '~hello': ['hell?o'] and each time pyborg will read 'hello'
or 'helo', it will replace the world by hello. The '~' as now role for now, but
says to pyborg that the word is an alias and can be used in the future.

NOTE: Terminate the borg with the !quit command or CTRL-C in the
console. Do not simply close the console window or the dictionary
will not be saved.
