#Wusif - A bot for the Gods

Wusif is based completely on PyBorg, a python based bot. LazerDX changed what he needed/wanted.

There's probably a trillion ways to crash it, good luck.

Check out Commands-List for a nice list of commands.

PyBorg 1.1.0 needs Python 1.5.2 or greater (www.python.org).
The 'irclib' and 'ircbot' modules in the PyBorg archive were written by Joel
Rosdahl (www.rosdahl.net). PyBorg has been tested on linux, windows and BSD
and /may/ work on other Python platforms.

'python pyborg-linein.py' to chat with the bot offline.
'python pyborg-irc.py' for irc mode.

Use convert2.py to convert pyborg olders dictionaries to pyborg 1.1.0
format. The dictionary is stored in lines.dat and words.dat and saved in a zip
file.
